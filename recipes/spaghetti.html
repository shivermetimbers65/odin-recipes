    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water, and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum-wheat semolina.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart sunflower oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>6 medium green zucchini</li>
        <li>4 ounces spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 basil leaves, torn into small pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place sunflower oil in a deep fryer and heat to 350 degrees F</li>
        <li>Add some zucchini to the hot oil and deep-fry until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a single layer on paper towels to drain and repeat to cook remaining zucchini. Let zucchini cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooled zucchini to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add zucchini and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until it starts to release juices, soften, and break down, 3 to 5 minutes. Add a couple splashes of the pasta water to the zucchini, but don't overdo it.</li>
        <li>Grab spaghetti with tongs and transfer it right into the sauce; stir until coated. Mix in Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses. Add a final splash of pasta water and adjust salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve with more grated cheese and fresh basil.</li>
    </ol>
